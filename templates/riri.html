			These are easily three of the best websites on the internet! The first is Bad Girl Riri's own website were we can snatch up her official merch and keep update with the media she wants us to see!!! The second website is the stongest fan page for Riri that there is right now! I check it every monday morning before I go about my business! Finally, the third website is daily updates on Rihanna! This is what I have read before going to sleep every night for the last 10 years! You're gunna love these websites!!!

		<ul>

			These are some of the best activities that you can do as a Rihanna Fan. You see, I seperate them because the listening expirence is so different. Like I would never listen to ANTI in the morning unless it is raining. Loud is best at night. Talk That Talk... pregame.
